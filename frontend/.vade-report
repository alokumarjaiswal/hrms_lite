## Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the HRMS Lite React application.

### Changes Made

**Modified Files:**
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added Vercel Analytics component integration
   - Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component to the app structure, placed after the `</Layout>` but inside `<BrowserRouter>` for proper route tracking

2. `package.json` - Added Vercel Analytics dependency
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 to dependencies

3. `package-lock.json` - Updated lockfile with new dependency tree
   - Added 118 new packages required by @vercel/analytics

### Implementation Details

This is a **Vite + React + TypeScript** application, so I followed the React implementation pattern from the Vercel Web Analytics guide:

- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` package import
- Placed the `<Analytics />` component at the root level of the App component
- The component is positioned outside the Layout but inside BrowserRouter to ensure proper route tracking with react-router-dom

### How It Works

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The Analytics component will automatically track page views and visitor data
2. Route changes will be captured thanks to react-router-dom integration
3. Data will be available in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
4. A Fetch/XHR request to `/_vercel/insights/view` will be visible in the browser's Network tab

### Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
✅ All dependencies installed correctly
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Analytics component properly integrated following React best practices

### Next Steps for Deployment

To enable analytics on Vercel:
1. Deploy this code to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or via Git integration
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics → Enable)
3. After deployment, visit the site and verify the `/_vercel/insights/view` request appears in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard after users visit the site
